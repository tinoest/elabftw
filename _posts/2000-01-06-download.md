## Download

So you have decided to give a chance to eLab? Great!

Have a look at **[the documentation](https://elabftw.rtfd.org)** to read how to install it.

I don't have time for reading, just let me **[download the zip archive](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/archive/master.zip)**!

You can also git clone it :
